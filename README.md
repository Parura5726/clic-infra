# Clic server configuration
This repository contains the complete configuration of the Clic's server.

Each service has a `docker-compose` file in the `/stacks` directory, and a dedicated directory for its configuration files.

The `/playbooks` directory contains [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) scripts for automated installation and deployment.
